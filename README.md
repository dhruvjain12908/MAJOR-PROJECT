MULTICLASS IMAGE CLASSIFICATION PROJECT



This project is based on multiclass image classification, an upgrade for binary classification which was my previous project This project includes the usage of TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, matplotlib, OpenCV, Numpy The algorithms used are: Relu, softmax Optimizers used: Adam

The dataset divided into 6 classes is used the classes are: 'buildings','forest','glacier','mountain','sea','street'
